# Netsoc Website

This is the repository for the Netsoc homepage and blog site.
The site itself is built with Astro.js, Tailwind CSS, and Strapi.

## Getting started

### Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js and NPM installed, then run `npm install` to have
NPM install all the required packages for you.

See the documentation for the [`ucdnetsoc/netsoc-cms`](https://github.com/ucdnetsoc/netsoc-cms) repository to set up a local Strapi dev server.

Once the CMS is up, run `npm run dev` to start the Astro dev server.
